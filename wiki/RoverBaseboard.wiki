 # Black 2-pin header on POWER and RST
 # Black 3-pin header on BECSEL

=== Control Port ===
 # Yellow 4-pin header on CONTROL:SIG
 # Red 4-pin header on CONTROL:5V/6V
 # Black 4-pin header on CONTROL:GND

=== Encoders Port ===
 # Black 4-pin header on one of two ENCODERS
 # White 4-pin header on one of two ENCODERS

=== I2C Port ===
 # Yellow 5-pin header on I2C:SDA
 # Blue 5-pin header on I2C:SCL
 # 2x Red 5-pin header on I2C:3V and IC2:5V
 # Black 5-pin header on I2C:GND, 

=== UART Ports ===
 # Black 5-pin headers on UART0, UART1, UART2, UART3

=== Rear analog/digital/pwm ports ===
 # Yellow 11-pin header on rearmost port with 11 pins, SIG
 # Red 11-pin header on rearmost port with 11 pins, 3.3V
 # Black 11-pin header on rearmost port with 11 pins, GND

== Install 5V Regulator ==

 # Rev 0.5 boards: don't install the regulator.

= Power =

You can power your !RoverBaseboard in the following ways.

 * Power with an external 5V supply
   * Connect the 5VIN/GND port to your 5V supply
   * jumper 5VIN to 5V
 * Power with your ESC's BEC
   * If your BEC is 5V, jumper VBEC to 5V
   * If your BEC is 6V, jumper VBEC to REG
   * Connect CONTROL:SPEED to your ESC through RoverMux
